üëã Hi, I‚Äôm Greg Baugh, a full stack developer based in Melbourne, Australia. Welcome to my GitHub page!

My first exposure to coding was an old BBC Micro that my mum brought home from her work. They were about to be dumped and she thought I may be interested. Along with a box of 5.25‚Äù floppy disks and a book on the BASIC programming language, I became fascinated with code and its possibilities (10 PRINT ‚ÄúHello, World!‚Äù). Shortly afterwards I acquired a second hand Pentium PC running Windows 95 and fell in love with web 1.0 through the medium of dial up internet (Hello, Geocities!)

As my high school didn‚Äôt provide qualifications in IT, I followed my other passions, music and music technology. Working within the live music and higher education sectors for many years equipped me with a multitude of valuable, transferable skills. Alongside dealing with excitable concert goers and Physics professors (albeit not at the same time), I also honed exceptional time management, communication, interpersonal and organisational skills.

Since relocating to Melbourne in 2018 to live with my Australian husband, I‚Äôve been in a period of career reflection and intense study. I‚Äôm skilled working in full stack development and feel a particular affinity to the back end. As someone who loves to learn, one of the most exciting things to me about software and web development is that there‚Äôs always new technologies and skills to learn. I currently work at Afterpay (Cash App - Block) as a software engineer.

I love developing modern applications using the following technologies:
- React
- Typescript
- NodeJS
- Java
- Kotling
- Spring Boot
- PHP
- SQL and NoSQL databases (MySQL, Postgres, MongoDB)
